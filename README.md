CredentialParser
===============

Install with pip (Hopefully works)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/zachhanson94/credparser.git
```

That should install a script called credparser which you can use like...
```bash
credparser -u [db username] -p [db password] -d [db name] -t [db table] [file] [[file] [file] ... ]
```
